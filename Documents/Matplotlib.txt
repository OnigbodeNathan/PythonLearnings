matplotlib
note to print the graph you have to use plt.show()
 it works as a print graph statement
functional method and  object oriented method
use .subplot() to plot multiple graphs in the same page
use .figure() to create a blank canvas
use .add_axes([left,bottom,width,height]) to create a graph 
*note the values must be less than 1
for oop use set_xlabel() as opposed to functional which you only use xlabel()
same as to set_title() and title()
use .tight_layout() to space overlapping graphs
.subplot auto configures your axes for you

figure size aspect ratio and DPI(dots per inch)
use .figure(nrows,ncols, figsize=(length,height), DPI)
use .savefig("filename.extension") to save
use .legend(loc=0) to add legend  *note make sure you have labelled your plots
use .plot(x,y,  color='color',linewidth=int,alpha = < 1, linestyle = 'signs'
		marker = 'specified letters and signs', markersize = int
		, markerfacecolor = 'color',markeredgewidth = int,
		 markeredgecolor = 'color')
 to set the color, linewidth and transparency, and marker points
use .set_xlim([from int, to int])
