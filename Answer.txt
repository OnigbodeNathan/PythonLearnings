## Copilot
Sure! Here's a simple example of a Node.js application that creates a basic web server:

// Load the http module to create an HTTP server.
const http = require('http');

// Configure the HTTP server to respond with "Hello World" to all requests.
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

// Listen on port 3000, IP defaults to 127.0.0.1
server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});

To run this code:
- Save it in a file named app.js.
- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where app.js is saved.
- Run the command node app.js.
- Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to see the "Hello World" message.

3. Workflow and System Architecture
High-Level Workflow:
1.	Input: A repository of educational resources (videos, articles, exercises) is ingested into the system.
2.	Preprocessing: Text from resources is extracted, with non-text formats (audio/video) transcribed.
3.	Classification and Tagging: NLP models categorize and tag resources based on curriculum and keywords.
4.	Clustering and Organization: Resources are grouped based on similarity to streamline access.
5.	Recommendations: Based on users’ curriculum needs or previous interactions, relevant resources are recommended.
6.	Adaptive Personalization: Ongoing user engagement adjusts future recommendations.
System Architecture:
•	Data Layer: Stores resources, metadata, and user interactions.
•	ML Layer: Contains NLP models and recommendation algorithms.
•	API Layer: Provides endpoints for lecturers and students to interact with the system, search, and receive recommendations.
•	User Interface: A dashboard or portal where users can view, search, and organize resources.

5. Challenges and Considerations
Some challenges include:
•	Ensuring Accuracy: Classification models must be fine-tuned to match specific curricula accurately.
•	Diversity in Resources: Resources must be vetted for quality and relevance to maintain high educational standards.
•	User Data Privacy: For personalized learning paths, user data must be securely handled, and privacy must be respected.
